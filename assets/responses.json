This file can be modified in accordance with the users requirements. The user may elect to insert an appropriate key inside this file and that will automatically be populated at the time of execution. The key format is defined by the use of the “<” and “>” characters. For example, the file ./tmp/responses.txt contains a stringify'ed array : the structure of that array is as follows : \n\n[inquirer input type],[The question asked to the user], [the field to be updated in the README.md file. In this scenario, the word <title> as defined in the ./assets/responses.json file will take the answer from inputted CLI and generate a new README.md file with this content], [the default response which is updated every time the user makes a change], [null <- this field is used internally by the application and cannot be changed]\n\nAfter the application completes, it will create two files (README.md & siteimg.jpeg) - These files will be contained in the directory, ./generated_content. Move these files to the root of your repository and everything is good to go.\n\nThe primary requirement of this assignment was to achieve the following : \n\nFunctional application.\n\n* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.\n\n* The generated README includes the following sections: \n\n  * Title\n  * Description\n  * Table of Contents\n  * Installation\n  * Usage\n  * License\n  * Contributing\n  * Tests\n  * Questions\n\n* The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository.\n\n\n","null"],["input","projectpurpose","What is purpose of the project :","<project.purpose>"," To assist in the design and build of a professional and easily used README.md file using a CLI editor from within NODE CLI console.","null"],["input","authors","Who are the project authors :","<authors>","David.
