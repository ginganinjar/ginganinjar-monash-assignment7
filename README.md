<p align="center"> Good README.md creator is a university assigned project designed to assist developers create a functioning README.md file without much work or pain. It automates most of the creation process creating a file that can be easily formed and designed.

Of special note :

The array, containing most of the information required for this project is contained in ./tmp/responses.txt <- this file is updated on the fly ensuring that users do not need to constantly update information that would otherwise be required.

The README.md file has been designed to present with significant information. Giving readers full access to badges, well formed layout and high presentation.

If an appropriate location is provided in terms of a production system, the CLI script will use an API to snap a production screenshot of the website and provide that also in the website.

The application also takes the authors information and provides that information with the file also.
