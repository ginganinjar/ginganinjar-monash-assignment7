<p align="center"> Given the increase in surveliance, we developed a Node based  MVC solution to provide users with a form of anonymous communication.

This node based application uses socket.io to allow for group and private peer to peer communications. All communication is totally private and is not recorded or saved either locally or on the web client. As soon as the web clients window is closed, the information is lost. Users are given the option of creating their own profile including personal contact information and other such information. The chat can be customised in various ways including the users ability to alter colors of their chosen communication strategy.
