<p align="center"> This application was mostly completed with all front end JS already working. The task here was to develop and build the back end functionality including the code for all routes and get/post requests.

I did also find a couple of minor issues with the CSS realting to the use of this application in mobile and corrected. I found the size of the rubbish bin slightly too small and would have liked to increase margins to improve functionality but did not want to overstep boundries.
